What are Open Educational Resources?
OER are teaching and learning materials that are freely and openly available. They can be text documents, audio, video, multimedia, tests, software, learning objects or any other tool used for learning and teaching. The key is that they can be widely distributed and adapted with clear reuse terms, often under a Creative Commons licence.

What can be done with an OER? The 5Rs
Retain - the right to make, own, and control copies of the content
Reuse - the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, on a website, in a video)
Revise - the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate)
Remix - the right to combine the original or revised content with other material to create something new
Redistribute - the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others
Benefits of OER
OER are affordable for students, making education more accessible
OER allow you to customize and adapt to your context, providing a richer teaching and learning opportunity
Students can benefit from multiple learning styles because OER can incorporate various content formats (text, audio, video or multimedia) and interactive elements

How to integrate OER into teaching
Find an existing OER: Use the resources suggested below to find out what currently exists.
Adopt an existing OER: Either use it as is or adapt it to your particular context or course. Because OER can be adapted, you can add or omit information, examples, and so on. You can also create your own OER.
Apply an open licence: Clearly state the conditions for reusing the OER that you have adapted or created by choosing a Creative Commons licence.
Share and distribute your OER: Share your OER in distribution networks so others can use it.
Reuse your OER: Use your OER in your classes year-after-year without needing to ask for permission.
